# Is My Internet Working?

A super simple website that tells you if your internet is working. That's it. No fancy stuff.

## What it does

- Shows "Yes" by default (because we're optimistic)
- Actually checks your internet connection by pinging Google
- Updates every 5 seconds
- Looks pretty in dark mode
- Has some cool animations

## How to use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. That's it. You're done.

## Why?

Because sometimes you just need to know if it's your internet or if the website is actually down.
